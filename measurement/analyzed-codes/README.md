# Analyzed codes

This directory contains 4 code examples with array operations written in three languages: Matlab/Octave, Scilab, and Python.
Each code example is built from combination of some [array operations](../array-operations/README.md).
For better descriptions see paper.

## List of analyzed codes

* Element-wise Matrix Vector multiplication (`EWMV`)
* Neural Network logistic activation function (`NN_logisitc`)
* PI estimation with Monte Carlo method (`MCPI`)
* Mutli-dimensional element-wise triad (`MD_triad`)
