# Array operations

This directory contains 17 functions with array operations written in three languages: Matlab/Octave, Scilab and Python.
Each array operation represents instruction used in the [analyzed codes](../examles/README.md).
Instructions that appear in two versions e.g. `vadd2`, `vadd3` are used for obtaining _one-sided coupling_ (see paper).

## List of tested array operations

* Element-wise addition (`vadd2`, `vadd3`)
* Element-wise division (`vdiv2`, `vdiv3`)
* Element-wise exponentation (`vexp`)
* Element-wise less than (`vless2`, `vless3`)
* Element-wise multiplication (`vmul2`, `vmul3`)
* Element-wise negation (`vneg`, `vnegneg`)
* Creating vector of uniformly distributed random values (`vrand`)
* Replicate row vector to form `N x N` matrix (`vrepmat`, `vrepmatneg`)
* Element-wise square (`vsquare`, `vsquaresquare`)
* Sum up vector elements (`vsum`)
